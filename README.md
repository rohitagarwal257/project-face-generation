My attempt at generating never-seen-before faces using DC-GAN

Deep Convolutional GAN's are another type of Generative Adversarial Networks wherein the generator and discriminator themselves are deep convolutional networks. This enables them to understand the basic structure fo input images - in this case celebrity images - and be able to generate realistic looking images.
